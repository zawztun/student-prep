Given I'm on the registration page  
When I fill out the form with name, grade (1-12), email, country, and state (if applicable)  
Then my information should be saved to the database  
And I should receive a confirmation message  
And a default study plan should be created for me with 3 sessions per week (Mon/Wed/Fri)  

Given I try to register with an email that already exists  
When I submit the form  
Then I should see an error message "A student with this email already exists"  

**Priority:** High
